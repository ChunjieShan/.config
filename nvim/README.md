# PangVim
#### An Ultimate (Neo)Vim config for Colemak users.

This is a (Neo)Vim configuration file referred to ThinkVim and David Chen's nvim config.  
Thanks to David and ThinkVim that I can create my config files.  

p.s. I'm a Colemak user, so if you are a QWERTY user, please modify core/mappings.vim first!

## Requirements
1. nodejs, and do `npm install -g neovim`
2. yarn
3. pynvim (It can be installed by `pip install pynvim`)

## Installation
Before you start to install, please make sure that you have NeoVim first(some of my plugins can only be used in NeoVim).  

`git clone https://github.com/chunjieshan/pangvim ~/.config/nvim`

There are 57 plugins installed with my favorite colorscheme 'deus' (version 0.4.1).
